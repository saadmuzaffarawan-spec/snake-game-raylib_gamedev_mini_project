# 🐍 Raylib Snake-Style Enemy System (C++)

A minimal enemy movement system built with Raylib + C++.
This project demonstrates structured data design, segment following logic, and basic game-loop updates for a snake-like enemy.

# The goal is to practice:

Struct-based game entities

Array-driven body segments

Directional movement

Clean update flow inside the main loop

# 🎯 Features

Enemy with head + body segments

Dynamic length control

Grid-based movement

Direction vector system

Simple and readable code structure

Beginner-friendly game logic

# 🧠 Concepts Used

C++ struct for entity modeling

Fixed-size arrays for body segments

Vector2 for position and direction

Segment follow algorithm

Game loop update pattern

This project focuses on logic clarity, not graphics complexity.
